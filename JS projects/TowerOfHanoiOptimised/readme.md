# Tower of Hanoi without Recursion or Stack

The provided Java code solves the classic problem of the Tower of Hanoi without using recursion or stacks. The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The objective is to move the entire stack of disks from one rod to another, following certain rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Code Explanation

### `generateString(int x)`
- This method generates a string by appending numbers in a particular pattern.

### `doIt(int n)`
- The `doIt` method initializes arrays and performs the Tower of Hanoi puzzle logic without using recursion or stacks.

### `main`
- The `main` method executes the `doIt` method with an example of 4 disks.

## Algorithm Overview

The code uses a string manipulation approach to simulate the Tower of Hanoi puzzle without using the traditional recursive or stack-based methods. It manages the movement of disks from one rod to another following a specific pattern, based on the number of disks provided.

## How it Works

1. The number of disks and their positions are handled by converting a number sequence into a specific pattern to determine the movements of the disks.

2. The code simulates moving the disks in a sequence based on the pattern generated from the `generateString` method.

3. It keeps track of the movement of each disk without explicitly using recursive function calls or a stack data structure.

## Usage

The code can be modified by changing the number of disks in the `main` method to observe the Tower of Hanoi solution for different numbers of disks.

## Further Improvements

This non-traditional method of solving the Tower of Hanoi problem is an interesting approach. However, for larger numbers of disks, this implementation might become less efficient. Using an iterative or loop-based approach instead of recursion can be a good alternative, but it's crucial to optimize the code for larger disk numbers.

It's also beneficial to add comments within the code to explain the logic and improve readability for anyone reviewing or modifying the code.
